When a board is attached, the agent unloads the prerequisites that the board must have to be used with the IDE. These prerequisites are downloaded from the url https://ide.whitecatboard.org/boards/prerequisites.zip. If
the url becomes unreachable (network error or server error) the following actions are taken:

1) Use the prerequisites installed on the board. Maybe not the last, but the board should continue to work.

2) Use the latest prerequisites downloaded on the PC. Maybe not the last, but the board should continue to work.
